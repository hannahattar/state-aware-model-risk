# State-Aware Model Risk Visualization

Regime-aware diagnostics for short-horizon equity signals.  
This project evaluates out-of-sample predictive confidence and model performance across volatility regimes.

## Overview
- Feature construction and dataset assembly
- Classification-based next-day direction probabilities
- Confidence calibration and error anatomy
- Regime-aware evaluation and diagnostics

## Repository Structure
- `build_dataset.py`: feature engineering and targets
- `train_models.py`: model training
- `calibration.py`: confidence diagnostics
- `enhanced_regime_analysis.py`: regime-aware analysis
- `make_tables_figures.py`: paper-ready tables and figures

## Notes
This repository accompanies the research paper hosted on my personal website.
